CLASSIFICATION: {'raw_text': '```json\n{\n  "category": "account_access",\n  "explanation": "The issue involves the user being unable to log in after resetting their password, which directly relates to accessing their account."\n}\n```', 'error': 'Could not parse JSON from model response.'}
TROUBLESHOOTING_PLAN:
```markdown
### 1. Empathetic Summary
The user is unable to log in to their account after resetting their password, which can be frustrating when trying to regain access.

### 2. Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirm the user is entering the new password exactly as set, paying attention to case sensitivity and any special characters.
2. Ask the user to try logging in from a different browser or device to rule out cache or browser-related issues.
3. Verify that the password reset process was fully completed, including any required email confirmation links.
4. Suggest clearing the browser cache and cookies before attempting to log in again.
5. Check if the user is using the correct username or email associated with the account.
6. If multi-factor authentication (MFA) is enabled, ensure the user is completing that step correctly.

### 3. Follow-up Questions
- Did the user receive a confirmation email after resetting the password and click any required link?
- Is the user certain they are using the updated password and the correct username/email?
- Has the user tried logging in from a different device or browser?

### 4. Recommendation
At this stage, escalation is not immediately necessary. If the user continues to be unable to log in after these steps, escalate to the **account support team** for deeper account verification and potential manual reset or unlock.
