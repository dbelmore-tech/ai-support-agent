**1. Empathetic summary:**  
It sounds frustrating that your lithium battery isn’t charging properly despite having a DC-DC charger and solar panels set up. Let’s work through some steps to identify what might be causing this.

**2. Troubleshooting steps:**  
- Verify all wiring connections between the battery, DC-DC charger, and solar panels are secure and correctly installed according to the manufacturer’s instructions.  
- Check the DC-DC charger’s input and output voltages with a multimeter to confirm it is receiving power and delivering the correct charging voltage to the battery.  
- Inspect the solar panels for proper operation: ensure they are clean, oriented correctly, and producing expected voltage/current.  
- Confirm the lithium battery’s state of charge and health using a battery monitor or compatible diagnostic tool.  
- Review the DC-DC charger’s configuration settings to ensure it is programmed for lithium battery charging profiles.  
- Look for any error indicators or fault codes on the DC-DC charger or battery management system.

**3. Follow-up questions:**  
- What make and model are your lithium battery, DC-DC charger, and solar panels?  
- Have you recently changed or installed any components in this system?  
- Are there any error lights or messages displayed on the charger or battery management system?

**4. Recommendation:**  
If the above steps don’t resolve the issue or if you encounter complex error codes, escalate to the engineering team specializing in battery charging systems for deeper diagnostics and configuration support.
